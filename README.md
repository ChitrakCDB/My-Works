In this repository you'll find a collection of unsolved examples from The C Programming Language by Brian kernighan and Dennis Ritchie .

To run the program you need Windows , Linux or any other operating system on which you can compile the code.

I've made this codes on Codeblocks version 16.01


Now in

Task 4:

In this program we will print the Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion table from 0 to 300 with the uniform gap of 20,
I've used for loop here which makes the program look small and is easy to understand
First I have defined upper and lower limit and the gap to be maintained.
And then the for loop is executed and the table is printed in the output.

Task 5:

In this program I've made some minor changes in for loop and values of upper and lower and the table of task 4
Will be printed reverse.

Task 6:
I've used while loop to verify that the EOF function is either 0 or 1
In the program the while loop will be executed till the file is end and the output will be same as input.


Task 7:
This is same as task is but in this we're printing the value of EOF and the output will be -1.

Task 8:
In this program we'll count number of blank tabs and new lines in a input given by user in this I've 
Initially given 0 count to the variants and have used while loop till EOF and then have used if statement and in this if the statement is true the count will increase and the value will be printed


Task 9:
The program will replace one or more blank by a single blank in this I've once again used the while loop and if statement.


Task 10:
In this program the tabs will be replaced by \t backslash by \\ and back space by \b the while loop will be executed and the if conditions will be checked



Task 12:
In this program the while loop will be executed and the input will be printed one word per line as an output

Task 13:
The characters given by input will be replaced by $ sign and the spaces will be considered as a new line
I've used while loop and if statements.

Task 14:
In this program the output will be all the ascii characters and the ^ sign will indicate whether the characters is used or not.
I've first defines a name to the ascii characters and given the value to them after this I've used an array which will store all characters and then the while loop and for loop will be executed as per the input from the user.

Task 16:
In this  I've used 2 functions the first one will get the line
And second one will copy the line 
And the while loop and if conditions will executed and the line which is longest will be the output of the program.

The remaining programs will be uploaded soon
Stay tuned!
